## Ideas
+ carbon-concious maps / trip planning application
+ creates routes by bike / public transport / based off what is accessible to the user
+ ADA accessibility emphasis
+ carbon emission savings as a factor / show
+ web UI that's appealing / easy (autocomplete location?)
+ functionality for saving / reccommending routes

## win Eaton AI track
+ won't be full functionality but could generate a "trip" -- core functionality won't be ai just the places chosen could be

## google breadboard?
+ will be filled in after workshop


## Frameworks / Platforsm
+ google maps / openstreetmap apis?
+ whatever gemini probably for ai integration
+ js / react based frontend i can cook
+ need database -- mongodb atlas lowkey theres a track 4 it

## key things
+ full-stack connectivity can cook apis in c# just need to figure out how to query mongo -- maybe has built in integration into js i wouldn't be surpised
+ need to figure out how we r weighing diff factors into some sort of algorithim (emissions, time, type of transport) -> user customization? like they can prioritize different modes of transportation and that's factored in
